#  Epic Team 2 is Epic 


We will add actual README stuff when we feel like it.


Meanwhile. test page is up at http://hack.tacio.us


## Random notes


We have Bluetooth LE.

We use that to talk to the Xadow.


The general idea is that you wear a device that relays information about relative time.

Time is conveyed in terms of relative distances between planned events.  

For example, you eat breakfast at some given time, and plan on going for a walk at a later time.

The device will notify you when it is time to eat breakfast, and then gradually show you incremental changes in time passed or time remaining until the next planned activity (going for walk).

But instead of telling you exactly how many minutes you have from now until the next event you will instead see that, for example, one-quarter of the time between the two events has passed, then one half, and  so on.


You have a sense of passing time and time remaining but it is relative to event intervals and not expressed in absolute values.

So, when you look at this "unwatch" you will not think "I have 25 minutes until I go for a walk" but "I'm about 25% into the time for this current activity."

You set schedule items by sending messages over [Skynet](http://skynet.im), an Internet of Things communication tool.

You can do this using a Web interface or by sending text messages.

Skynet can also be used to send instant messages to the device.

In addition to the OLED display the device uses vibration and LEDs to indicate messages received and impending events.
